# Open Source Involvement

The order of entries on this page is an attempt to highlight projects based on recency and impact.

## __Current__

### [Omnigres](https://github.com/omnigres/omnigres)

Omnigres makes [Postgres](/postgres) a complete application platform. You can deploy a
single database instance and it can host your entire application, scaling as
needed.

!!! tip "Note"

    I am most actively involved in this project at the moment.

### [pgx](https://github.com/tcdi/pgx)

I [contribute](https://github.com/tcdi/pgx/commits?author=yrashk) to pgx, a library to build Postgres extensions in Rust with, on an
ongoing basis, primarily driven by needs of clients and my interests.

### [Postgres](https://postgresql.org/)

So far, I've proposed two small patches:

* [Extend the length of BackgroundWorker.bgw_library_name](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CA%2BRLCQyjFV5Y8tG5QgUb6gjteL4S3p%2B1gcyqWTqigyM93WZ9Pg%40mail.gmail.com "Not yet merged")
* [Allow Postgres to pick an unused port to listen](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CA%2BRLCQwJBGAnBo7OZ6QxqJjEn6w%3DMju9GrHQmwFxX_io%2B4Cwhw%40mail.gmail.com "Not yet merged")

### [git-paravendor](https://github.com/yrashk/git-paravendor)

I am developing a tool to vendorize dependencies alongside in the project repository.

This helps with workflows in absence of a good internet connection, and ensures
that dependencies that are gone are not going to have an immediate disrupting
impact on your project.

### [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit)

I've made a [tiny contribution](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/pull/3692) that makes it possible to use S3 cache without
authenticating (useful in CI, particularly in pull requests)

### [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/)

I've [contributed to Turbo Rails a bit](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails/commits?author=yrashk) when developing my startup HackerIntro.

## __Past__

Below are the contributions done in the deep past.

### [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)

In the early days, I've [contributed](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commits?author=yrashk) to Elixir programming language as I was deeply involved in the Erlang community
and was looking for ways to improve my code.
