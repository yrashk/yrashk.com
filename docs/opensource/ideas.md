These are some of the projects I would like to work on, but haven't started yet.

# Shell Scripting Language Compiler

A simple imperative language intended to be used for shell scripting. However, it won't
have an interpret. Instead, it'll compile code to targets like Bash, Dockerfile, etc. The idea
is to have a simple and sane language for shell scripting without requiring users to install
an interpreter.

Features may include some basic support for parallelization, JSON [^1] and tabular data processing, etc.

[^1]: Parsing JSON in pure Bash sounds like fun, right? People [have done it](https://github.com/dominictarr/JSON.sh), though.
      Maybe it can be written in the language itself.
