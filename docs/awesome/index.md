title: Awesome collection
---

You know all these "awesome" repositories that host a curated list of projects and materials
pertaining to a particular topic (often, a programming language community)?

Here's my cross-sectional "awesome" links collection. I was saving links in random places, but
I kept losing them. So I am trying to persist them here.


## Programming languages

### APL-inspired

* [BQN](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/) A modern take on APL?
* [Uiua](https://www.uiua.org/) A stack-based array programming language.
* [SaC](https://www.sac-home.org/index) Single-Assignment C is an array programming language predominantly suited for application areas such as numerically intensive applications and signal processing. Its distinctive feature is that it combines high-level program specifications with runtime efficiency similar to that of hand-optimized low-level specifications.

## Operating systems

* [Muen](https://muen.sk) An x86/64 Separation Kernel for High Assurance. Written in Ada/SPARK.
