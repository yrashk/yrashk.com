# About Me

__Professionally__, I am a software developer with a keen interest in reducing complexity with over 30 years of professional
experience.

Presently, I am doing a lot of work concerning using and extending [Postgres](postgres) database (extension development, [open source](opensource)
involvement, advisory). 

??? question "Which programming languages do I use?"

    These days, I use a lot of ==Rust== and ==C== (more of the latter when it comes to integrating with other software, like Postgres). Naturally,
    due to my current work, I am also doing a lot of SQL.

    That being said, I know a lot of other languages (to varying degrees of competency), such as: JavaScript, Ruby, [Zig](https://ziglang.org), Java,
    Python, etc.

__In personal life__, I am a husband and a father of one amazing daughter. I enjoy running, skiing, cycling and outdoors in general. Trying to figure out
sailing.
