My entrepreneurship journey is closely tied with the tech startup world. I have
done a few ventures in the past, to varying degress of success.

!!! question "Why do I do this?"

    For me, it is about the unlimited range of challenges and opportunities every
    day brings. Wearing many hats, and being ultimately responsible how well you
    will perform mentally, physically and financial is up to you. It's very raw, in
    a sense. You get what you put in, multiplied by the luck factor. Generally, no
    safety net. You're responsible for what happens.
