# Startup Ideas

## Hands-free writing

As somebody who doesn't have a lot of spare time I feel like I could have used a bit
of the "idle" time for something useful, like writing articles or blog posts. However,
this "idle" time usually means I am not home, not having my computer with me. At best,
I have my phone.

But writing on the phone sucks. Speech recognition isn't great either. It works
to a degree, but requires painful editing. 

The idea is to give a multi-model, hands-free-first writing experience on the phone and
other devices. Try to employ GPT to fix speech recognition mistakes, pad coarse input,
perform text manipulation.

## Save on Kids

!!! tip "Have saveonkids.com & saveonkids.ca"

This is similar to the [existing brick-and-mortar model](https://www.onceuponachild.com/)
where parents can buy and sell used children's clothes, shoes and toys. However, instead of
having to shop in person, turn this into an e-commerce store. Both local and shipping models
are worth exploring.
