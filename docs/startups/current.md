## [Omnigres](https://omnigres.com) (2022-)

Omnigres makes Postgres a complete application platform. You can deploy a
single database instance and it can host your entire application, scaling as
needed.

I started Omnigres because data-centric application development was getting more
complex and I was seeking an antidote for that. I believe Postgres can be a great
platform for such applications, especially considering its popularity. It needs a
much improved DX and a constellations of extensions that would make it just perfect.
That's Omnigres.
